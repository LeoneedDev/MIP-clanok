  abstract = "Gamification seeks to encourage behavior of participants by
              borrowing elements of games, such as scoring points. Few rigorous
              studies exist of gamification in software organizations, and
              several questions have remained unanswered, for example, what
              might drive developers to partake, and what are the consequences
              of developer engagement. This article seeks to provide some
              answers through a rigorous empirical study at one organization
              that created an internal gamification platform. We develop a
              theoretical model that seeks to explain why developers may
              participate, and develop the concept of developer engagement,
              which we link to job satisfaction. We collected data from two
              sources that were linked together: developer opinion data
              collected through a survey, and data from the organization's
              version control system. We test our theoretical model using
              structural equation modeling and moderation analysis, and find
              support for our model. These findings suggest that gamification
              can be an effective mechanism to engage developers within the
              organization, and that developer engagement is positively
              associated with job satisfaction, which is a key outcome that is
              of great interest to software organizations.",
